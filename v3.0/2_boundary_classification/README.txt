Boundary classification can be done either with Random Forest Classification or Convolutional Neural Network Classification.

Instructions on how to apply Random Forest Classification can be found in the wiki:

The wiki for the CNN classification is less detailed compared to all other wiki sections. We recommend using RF classification, as it is requires less computing power and memory. However, the CNN classification showed slightly better accuracy results, which are described in detail in a scientific publication that is currently under review.
