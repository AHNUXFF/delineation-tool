# Delineation-Tool
Contains documentation and scirpts for the boundary delineation tool developed for its4land combining gPb contour detection, SLIC superpixel, Random Forest classification and a QGIS plugin.

The tool is designed to support the semi-automatic delineation of visible cadastral boundaries from UAV data. The delineation tool combines the output from gPb contour detection and SLIC superpixels based on random forest classification. The subsequent interactive delineation is managed with the QGIS BoundaryDelineation plugin (https://github.com/SCrommelinck/BoundaryDelineation) This repository containts scripts and info on the other workflow parts and on the workflow as a whole.

This research is part of its4land (https://its4land.com/), a European Commission Horizon 2020 project that aims to deliver an innovative suite of land tenure recording tools. These tools are intended to respond to sub Saharan Africa’s immense challenge to rapidly and cost-effectively map millions of unrecognized or unrecorded land rights, in order to register them in formal land administration systems. An overview of the project was presented at the World Bank Conference on Land and Poverty (https://www.conftool.com/landandpoverty2017/index.php/11-07-Bennett-288_paper.pdf?page=downloadPaper&filename=11-07-Bennett-288_paper.pdf&form_id=288&form_version=final).

The work package (WP 5 – Automate It) that this plugin is developed for is part of its4land. It aims to exploit the use of high-resolution UAV imagery combined with an image interpretation workflow that automatically extracts relevant land tenure features from UAV data. These can be physical objects such as hedges, fences, stone walls, tree lines, roads, walkways or waterways that often demarcate cadastral boundaries. Such an approach cannot deliver complete matching – as some tenure boundaries are only social and not visible to sensors – however, even 50% matching would radically alter tenure mapping workflow costs and times. The scientific progress of finding optimal methods and combining them in a workflow is ongoing. A review on related issues and case studies, such as the combination of cadastral mapping and remote sensing as well as image-based feature extraction methods has been published (http://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/8/8/689). The initial workflow step – gPb contour detection – is explained, evaluated and published (http://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/9/2/171). The second workflow step – SLIC superpixels – is evaluated in (https://www.isprs-ann-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/IV-2-W3/9/2017/). The final workflow step – the combination of automatically extracted features through random forest - will be submitted soon. Info and scripts can be found in this repository.
