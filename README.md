# Delineation-Tool
This repository contains source code and guidance to apply our semi-automatic indirect surveying approach for cadastral mapping from remote sensing data. 

We advise to use the latest version (v3.0):

https://github.com/SCrommelinck/Delineation-Tool/tree/master/v3.0

### Workflow
The delineation tool consists of three steps:
   * (i) **image segmentation** to extract visible object outlines 
   * (ii) **boundary classification** to predict boundary likelihoods for extracted segment lines, and 
   * (iii) **interactive delineation** to connect these lines based on the predicted boundary likelihood.

### Usage
Our wiki provides a detailed guidance for each workflow step:
